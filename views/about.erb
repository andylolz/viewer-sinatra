    <h1>What is EveryPolitician?</h1>
    <p>
      The clue’s in the name. EveryPolitician aims to provide data
      about, well, every politician. In the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      It’s a simple but ambitious project to collect and share that
      data, in a consistent, open format that anyone can use.
    </p>
    <p>
      Why? Because this resource doesn’t yet exist. And it would be
      incredibly useful, for a huge number of people and organisations
      all around the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      When data is in a consistent, structured format, it can be reused
      by developers everywhere. You don’t have waste time scraping data
      and converting it into a format you can use; instead, you can
      simply concentrate on making useful tools. And those tools can
      more easily be picked up, used and adapted to local needs anywhere
      in the world, saving everyone time and effort.
    </p>

    <h2>The data</h2>
    <p>
      The long term aim is to include every elected official in the
      world, but let’s start simple. Our first goal is to have data for
      all present-day national-level legislators.
    </p>
    <p>
      To see what data we have, <a href="/">pick the country</a> and then the
      specific <em>chamber/house</em> and <em>legislative period</em>.

      We show you the basic list of who the members were (or, the ones
      we know of), but usually we also have more information than what’s
      displayed: contact details, photos, gender, etc.  
      
      If you want to use that data, you can download it in two useful formats:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <abbr title="comma separated value">CSV</abbr> format (great for spreadsheets)
      </li>
      <li>
        <abbr title="JavaScript Object Notation">JSON</abbr> in Popolo format (ideal for
          developers)
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      A note about the Popolo standard: it’s a rich, expressive format that,
      like a language, is used in many different ways by different authors.
      However, when we add data to EveryPolitician we always use Popolo
      according to the same, defined principles. It’s because of this
      consistency that the tools you build will work with EveryPolitician data
      from any country, for any country.
    </p>

      application or tool you’re building? See the <a

    <h2>How can I add or correct information?</h2>

    <p>See our handy guide to <a href="/contribute.html">contributing</a>.

    <h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

    <p>The data can also be used in bigger projects, such as making it
    easy to <a href="http://sayit.poplus.org/">track what those politicians say</a>, or
    <a href="http://www.cargografias.org/">visualise their political careers</a>, or
    for citizens to <a href="http://writeit.poplus.org/">send public messages to them</a>. </p>

    <p>As data becomes available from more countries, all in the same format,
    more and more tools will become possible.</p>
