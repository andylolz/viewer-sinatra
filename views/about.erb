    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>Help ua build a publicly available, distributed, open list of all the
    world’s politicians, in a standardised format. </p>

    <h2 id="why">Why?</h2>

    <p>Because, if data is in a standard structured format, it can be reused by
    developers everywhere. They don’t have waste time scraping data and
    converting it into a format they can use; instead, they can simply
    concentrate on making useful tools. </p>

    <p>And those tools can more easily be picked up, used and adapted to local
    needs anywhere in the world, saving everyone time and effort.</p>

    <p>That standardised format is <a href="http://www.popoloproject.com/">Popolo</a>, the
    new data standard for politicians’ details.</p>

    <h2 id="how-do-i-get-involved">How do I get involved?</h2>

    <p>If you‘ve already published Popolo format data for your country’s
    politicians, let us know, and we’ll add it to the growing <a href="/">list</a>.</p>

    <p>If you can create a CSV file (for example, by exporting it from a
    spreadsheet) with that information, we have tools that will probably convert 
    that quite easily — <a href="mailto:team@everypolitician.org"</a>contact us</a> 
    and let’s see if it we can get it uploaded.</p>

    <p>If you have the information in another format, and would like assistance
    converting it to Popolo, talk to us, and we’ll see if we can help. </p>

    <h2 id="which-politicians-do-you-care-about">Which politicians do you care about?</h2>

    <p>Initially we’re only collecting information about 
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_legislatures_by_country">country-level Parliaments and Congresses</a>.
    Eventually we hope that much more than this will be available, but we
    think that getting every national legislature would be a great first
    step.</p>

    <h2 id="what-information-about-them-do-you-want">What information about them do you want?</h2>

    <p>Popolo lets you express lots of complex information about your
    politicians and their history. If you have the time and skills to put
    lots of that together, then great! The UK data, for example, lists 
    <a href="https://parliament.popit.mysociety.org/persons/">every Member of Parliament for the last 100 years</a>. </p>

    <p>But for now we’re simply focussed on getting basic information about the
    current legislators in every country. Even if you can only provide their
    names, political parties, and areas they represent, that‘s plenty. Part
    of the beauty of Popolo is that it’s easy to add more complex data at
    any stage, and we’ll be encouraging people to do just that later.</p>

    <h2 id="what-next">What next?</h2>

    <p>Th data can also be used in bigger projects, such as making it
    easy to <a href="http://sayit.poplus.org/">track what those politicians say</a>, or
    <a href="http://www.cargografias.org/">visualise their political careers</a>, or
    for citizens to <a href="http://writeit.poplus.org/">send public messages to them</a>. </p>

    <p>As data becomes available from more countries, all in the same format,
    more and more tools will become possible.</p>
